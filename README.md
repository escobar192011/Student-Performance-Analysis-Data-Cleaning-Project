# Student Performance Analysis: Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a data cleaning project focused on analyzing student performance in secondary education, specifically in Mathematics. The project utilizes the `student-mat.csv` dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features collected via school reports and questionnaires.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/escobar192011/student-performance-analysis.git


2. Navigate into the project directory:
cd student-performance-analysis



3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib # Add any other dependencies

## Usage
### Running Jupyter Notebooks

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using:
pip install jupyter

2. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/escobar192011/student-performance-analysis.git
cd student-performance-analysis

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

4. Open the notebook `student_performance_uci_mlr_data_cleaning.ipynb`

### Executing Code

- Run all cells in the notebook to execute the data cleaning and analysis processes.
- Modify parameters or experiment with different approaches as needed.

### Interpreting Results

- The notebook will output visualizations and summaries that analyze student performance based on the `student-mat.csv` dataset.

### Additional Dependencies

- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the libraries specified in the installation section (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.).

### Example Usage

- Explore different data cleaning techniques or modify visualizations to gain insights into student performance factors.
- Experiment with machine learning models or statistical analyses if extending the project's scope.

## Data Description
The `student-mat.csv` dataset contains 395 entries and includes the following columns:
- `school`: student's school (binary: 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira)
- `sex`: student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male)
- `age`: student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)
- `address`: student's home address type (binary: 'U' - urban or 'R' - rural)
- ...

For a detailed description of each column, refer to the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).
